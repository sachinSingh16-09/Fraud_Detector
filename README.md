<h1 align="center"> SELF ORGANISING MAPS(fraud detector) </h1>

  In this project, i have created a Deep Learning model for a bank. A dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card, is provided by the bank. This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. This model detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that the model come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications. I have used self organising maps to build this model.
